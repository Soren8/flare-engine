# The credits cutscenes mostly contain names of people that we don't want to translate.
# However, there are a few strings that we DO want translated, which we define in this file.
#
# Use the 'file' key to specify a cutscene file that contains credits.
# Use the 's' key to specify a string that is allowed to be translated in any of the cutscenes.
#
# This file is meant to be parsed by the xgettext.py script in the flare-engine "tools" folder
# The script will try to load it from the target languages directory.
# If it doesn't exist, it will try to load from flare-engine's default mod (i.e., the file you're reading right now).
